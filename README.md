## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeyneptekiin/user-auth-case.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd user-auth-case
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tools & Components

### Libraries Used

- **React OTP Input**: Used for handling One-Time Password (OTP) input fields efficiently, with built-in validation and styling options.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for fast, utility-first styling, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across the application without the need for custom CSS.

- **React Hook Form**: Implemented for managing forms, providing efficient validation, state management, and reducing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Zustand**: A lightweight state management library used to manage global state for authentication, such as storing user credentials (email, password, username) and handling authentication-related logic (e.g., login, logout).

### Custom Components

- **Navbar**: A custom navigation bar component for consistent header navigation across the application.

- **Input**: A reusable input field component with integrated validation, designed to work seamlessly with **React Hook Form**.

- **PasswordModal**: A modal component specifically for handling password requirements and feedback to the user when they interact with the password input field.

- **Button**: A custom button component for consistent styling and behavior across different parts of the application.

## Error Handling

In this project, **Axios** is used for making HTTP requests, and error handling is implemented using **try-catch** blocks to ensure fault tolerance.

- **Axios**: Axios is used to manage HTTP requests and handle responses efficiently. It also provides easy error handling through `axios.isAxiosError()` to differentiate between different types of errors and handle them appropriately.

- **Try-Catch**: All API requests are wrapped in `try-catch` blocks to ensure that any error occurring during the request or response handling is caught and managed gracefully. If an error occurs, meaningful error messages are returned to the user to improve user experience and debugging.

## OTP Verification

To perform OTP verification, the system requires **email** and **password** to be sent again during the OTP request. To avoid asking the user to re-enter their email and password, these values are temporarily stored in **Zustand** state and cleared after the OTP request is completed.

### âš  Security Note:

Storing sensitive information like **email** and **password** in the frontend state management (such as **Zustand**) can pose a **security risk** because these values are stored in the browser's memory until they are cleared.

### Token Storage

The **auth token** is stored in a **cookie** for the following reasons:

- Cookies provide a secure and convenient way to persist session data across multiple pages or tabs in a browser.
- By setting proper attributes such as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite`, cookies can offer improved security over alternatives like `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

The token stored in a cookie is used to maintain the authenticated state of the user, allowing seamless navigation between pages while keeping the session secure.

## Running Tests

### Jest Tests

To run the Jest tests:

```bash
npm run test:jest
```
#### Jest Test Coverage Summary:

| Metric  | Coverage  |
|---------|-----------|
| **Statements** | 96.61%   |
| **Branches** | 84.7%    |
| **Functions** | 91.66%   |
| **Lines** | 96.61%   |


### Cypress Tests

First, ensure the development server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, in a new terminal window, run the Cypress tests:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

**Note:** If the server is not running, you may encounter the following error:

```
Cypress could not verify that this server is running:

http://localhost:3000

This server has been configured as your baseUrl, and tests will likely fail if it is not running.
```

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is configured to automatically run tests and deploy the application upon every push or pull request to the main branch.

### Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed via the following URL:

[https://user-auth-case.vercel.app/](https://user-auth-case.vercel.app/)

Additionally, the Vercel deployment has been connected to a custom subdomain:

[https://ycc.usrt.xyz/](https://ycc.usrt.xyz/)

## Performance Improvements

This project has undergone performance optimizations based on **Google Lighthouse** test results to enhance load times and overall user experience.

### Lighthouse Tests & Optimizations

Several key improvements were implemented after running **Lighthouse** tests, focusing on optimizing the rendering of the page and reducing unnecessary file loads:

- **Enabled Just-In-Time (JIT) Mode**:
  The **JIT mode** for Tailwind CSS was enabled, allowing for faster build times and reducing the size of the generated CSS by only including the classes that are actually used. This led to a significant reduction in CSS file size, improving page load speed.

- **Moved Font Import to Layout**:
  Instead of importing the font in the CSS file, the web font import was moved to the **Next.js Layout component**. This reduces the render-blocking behavior caused by external CSS file loads and improves **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**. The web font is loaded with `font-display: swap`, ensuring text is immediately visible with a fallback font while the custom font loads.

These optimizations contributed to improved loading speeds, quicker interactivity, and better Lighthouse performance scores.

### Lighthouse Test Results

After making these optimizations, Lighthouse tests were run for both **desktop** and **mobile** versions of the application. Below are the results:

#### Desktop Results:
- **Performance**: 100
- **Accessibility**: 94
- **Best Practices**: 100
- **SEO**: 100

#### Mobile Results:
- **Performance**: 87
- **Accessibility**: 94
- **Best Practices**: 100
- **SEO**: 100
